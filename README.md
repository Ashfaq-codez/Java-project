## Java full stack project

# Project: Space Organizer

The Space Organizer is a web application that helps users organize their physical and digital spaces. This project showcases my skills in both front-end and back-end development:

- **Front-end**: Designed a responsive and engaging user interface using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap. The design includes interactive buttons, smooth scrolling, and personalized content.
- **Back-end**: Built using Java, JSP, and servlets for handling server-side logic and generating dynamic content. 
- **Database**: Integrated with a MySQL database to manage user data efficiently.

Key Features:
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures a great user experience on all devices.
- **Dynamic Content**: Real-time updates and personalized tips based on user input.
- **User Input**: Captures the user's name to personalize organizing tips.
- **Visual Appeal**: Colorful and interactive elements enhance the user interface.

This project demonstrates my ability to develop full-stack applications using Java technologies and create engaging front-end designs. It's a great example of my skills in building dynamic, user-focused web applications.
